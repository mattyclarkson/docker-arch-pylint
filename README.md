This container derives from
[vcatechnology/arch-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch-ci) so that the
image has the latest [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for performing PyLint checking.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/arch-pylint](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch-pylint/)
